# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to tabulate descriptive statistics for the provided ride-sharing data based on city type (rural, suburban, urban) by using the groupby function, and count and sum method. The pivot function and resample method is then used to generate a multiple-line chart plotting the total number of fares per city type from January ro April 2019.

## Results
From the table below we can can conclude the following:

- The average fare per ride is the most expensive for rural riders.
- The average fare per driver is significantly higher than the average fare per ride for the rural city type.
- There are more drivers than total rides for the urban city type.
- The revenue for urban city type is more than double the amount the next highest revenue which is generated by the suburban city type.

From the above graph we can can see that urban fares generate the most revenue followed suburban and rural. Rural is signifcantly lower than the other two types. At no point does suburban total fare ever pass urban. Additionally rural never passes urban nor rural. Even though there are a few peaks, the total fare for each type typically remains in a range $5.00 between the lowest and highest fares. There are a handful of days for the urban and rural type that do reach beyond the $5.00 range, but they are not the norm.

## Summary
Based upon these results the following recommendations are suggested.
- Decreasing the total number of drivers for the urban city type as there are more drivers than total rides.
- Decrease the fare for rural riders to encourage rural riders to use ride-sharing. The distance they travel is significantly farther than the other two city types, making each rider's trip more expensive.
- Increase the number of drivers for rual and suburban to equalize the average fare per driver.
